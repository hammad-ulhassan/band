# Bands

## Running App locally
1. make `env.development.local` file @ root dir
2. add `REACT_APP_MAP_BOX_API` with your `mapbox-gl` access token. You can sign-up for an access token [here](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/getting-started/access-tokens/).
3. run `npm run start`
4. check [your local server]

## Operating the app
1. Enter a band name at the top input and hit `enter`
2. Events' Venues would show at the bottom with details

## Caveats
1. I tried to deploy on `Netlify` but Mapbox is broken for production. 



[your local server]: http://localhost:3000
